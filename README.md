# Bank Logos
## About
This is a collection of bank logos in svg format. To be used in many mobile and web applications.
This project attempts to collect most of the large, medium, and maybe smaller banks around the world.

People are encouraged to make pull requests to fix or add new banks.

## TODO
### Phase 1
- Create structure for storing bank logos
- Search for complete list of world banks. Maybe not from wikipedia so that we can get some ISO codes for identities. That way this could integrate better with other frameworks.
- Create generic bank logo. All banks will initially default to this logo.
- Populate logos for major North America banks.
- Create bower package.
- Create npm package.
- Populate logos for medium/small North America banks.

### Phase 2
- Populate logos for major Europe banks.
- Populate logos for major South America banks.
- Populate logos for major Asia banks.
- Populate logos for major Africa banks.
- Populate logos for pending banks...
